I have selected the data set which I did for my first project.
The data set is googlestore apps reviews and ratings.


Things I have done::

1.Since the count of ratings which are null are high and some of them greater than 5 lets remove them

Now the story begins:::
 1. The category which has the highest rating is Education
 2. The genre which has highest average rating is Comics;Creativity and Board;Pretend Play
 3. Rating vs Installs
 4. The amount of different age group people who rated different categories of apps
 5. Graph shows how much percentage of everyone category rated each app
 6. Effect of type of applications on ratings::
     Observation:
       1.Pay give higher ratings when they pay

       2.Adults don't rate paid apps
 7. Paid Apps vs Ratings
 8. Rating and Reviews of Genres
 9. Merging the user reviews on the apps dataset
 10. Category Vs Each Sentiment count
